## Evaluating sentence representation

In lab 2, we implemented and trained three different models to learn the word embeddings: Skip-gram, Bayesian skip-gram,
and EmbedAlign. We now compare the obtained word representations using SentEval, a Facebook evaluation toolkit for
evaluating the quality of sentence embeddings through a diverse set of downstream _transfer_ tasks.
